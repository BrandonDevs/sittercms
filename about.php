   <h3>Our Goal:</h3>

   <p>ABC Childcare Center is much more than a daycare, it’s a learning adventure! We believe in fun learning, engaging all the senses and active bodies. We offer learning rooms where lessons range from mastering math to learning a new language…Bon jour!</p>

   <p>Meditation rooms offer children an opportunity for yoga or just a great space to relax and/or nap. Nutrition education means we explain to them why the snacks and meals are healthy and we believe in fostering a love of sports, play and most importantly good sportsmanship.</p>

   <p>Also, with parent/guardian permission, we take monthly field trips to such places as museums, parks and more. Learn more about these and some of our other activities at our <a href="activities.php">activities page</a></p>

<h3>Our Facility:</h3>

   <p>Our building, located at 3912 Honey Creek Rd, Modesto, CA 95356, is 6,000 sq. ft of awesome! From the calming receiving room to the activity rooms, to our
secure playground, your child will be excited to come back! We feature a full kitchen, handicap accessible bathrooms, parent's lounge, meditation room, music and dance
room, 7 classrooms and indoor gym. Our building is inspected 4 times a year to ensure all safety equipment is fully functional so you can trust your child will be safe
and secure.</p>

<h3>Our Staff:</h3>

   <p>The wonderful caregivers here at ABC Childcare Center must pass rigorous exams and background checks including criminal and DHS (Department of Human Services).</p>
   <p>In addition they must meet our criteria for child friendly instruction and care. We know you don't take your children's welfare for granted and neither do we.</p>
